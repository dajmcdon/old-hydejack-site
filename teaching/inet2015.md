## Course description


Largely unnoticed by economists, over the last three decades
statisticians and computer scientists have developed sophisticated
prediction procedures and methods of model selection and forecast
evaluation under the rubric of statistical learning theory. These
methods have revolutionized pattern recognition and artificial
intelligence, and the modern industry of data mining (without the
pejorative connotation) would not exist without it.

In this short course, we will investigate the connections between
modern statistical methodology and standard techniques which are more
common in economics and social science. The goal is to develop an
understanding for the circumstances under which different statistical
methods are appropriate, how methods behave when the model for the
data generating process is incorrect, and why some methods can adapt
while others cannot. We will focus especially on selecting models with
good predictive performance and on the relationships between model
complexity, statistical estimation, and the amount of data used to
estimate the model.

The starting point for statistical learning is the notion of
predictive risk and the tradeoff between bias and variance. With this
tradeoff in mind, we will investigate the importance of assessing
models using training and test data, the benefits of regularization,
and the necessity of selecting tuning parameters carefully. We will
illustrate each of these issues with some standard econometric
procedures applied to financial and economic datasets while at the
same time, introducing some potentially new procedures which may be
useful in your own research.

9. Application: Predicting recessions
9. Collaborative filtering and the Netflix prize
1. Dimension reduction


## Suggested preparation

In order to be best prepared for this course, we suggest that you
brush up on your econometrics, especially the content about
probability. Most useful will be to remind your self about expected
values and variance, convergence in probability and consistency,
maximum likelihood, ordinary least squares and some time series topics
like autoregressive models. Also, remind yourself what a dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium model is (you probably know more about
this than we do, but perhaps not). Less useful are GMM techniques and
cointegration.

Before coming to class, we suggest that you take a look at the first
three (3) chapters of Cosma Shalizi's preprint 
[Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/).
These chapters will serve as a nice introduction to the materials we intend to
cover. The rest of the book is great too if you are feeling more
ambitious/motivated.


## Preliminary exercises

We will make a handful of exercises available to try before you come
to class. These are mainly for review and little else. They will
certainly not be graded, but spending a few hours trying them may help
you come to class more prepared. The exercises are [here](/assets/teaching/inet2013/prelimQuestions.pdf).

## Data analysis

All of the data analysis examples we use in class will be done in the
open source programming language R. R is extremely
powerful and easily extensible. We will try to make all of our code
available on the website so that you may experiment with it. The
software is available for free on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). An
official introduction is available there, and many other introductions
are available on the web. See for example [here](/code-links.html). Feel free to download and play around with
R, but experience and/or mastery of computer programming is not
necessary.
