    event: After a lengthy process, I've left Indiana University to join [Tamara Mitchell](https://tamaraleemitchell.github.io) at UBC. I'm ecstatic to join a fantastic department with many wonderful new colleagues, but I'll be sad to say good bye to many others. If you're facing academic partner issues and are interested in my thoughts, drop me a line.

## Biography 

Daniel McDonald is Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Before moving north, Daniel spent 8 years on the faculty at Indiana University, Bloomington. His research interests involve the estimation and
quantification of prediction risk, especially developing methods for evaluating the predictive
abilities of complex dependent data. This includes the application of statistical learning
techniques to time series prediction problems in the context of economic forecasting, as well as
investigations of cross-validation and the bootstrap for risk estimation.


Daniel did his undergraduate studies at Indiana University where he received two bachelors degrees:
a Bachelor of Science in Music with a concentration in cello performance from the Jacobs School of
Music and a Bachelor of Arts in economics and mathematics. Prior to graduate school, he worked as a
Research Associate at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He received his Ph.D. from Carnegie
Mellon University in statistics where he was named graduate student of the year for 2012 and
received the Umesh Gavasakar Memorial Thesis Award for his dissertation "Generalization Error
Bounds for State Space Models." In 2017, he was a recipient of the Indiana University Trustees
Teaching Award. In 2018, he received an NSF CAREER award. His work has also been supported by
grants from the Institute for New Economic Thinking.
