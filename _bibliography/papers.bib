	title = {An Open Repository of Real-Time COVID-19 Indicators},
	year = {2021},
	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic presented enormous data challenges in the United States. Policy makers, epidemiological modelers, and health researchers all require up-to-date data on the pandemic and relevant public behavior, ideally at fine spatial and temporal resolution. The COVIDcast API is our attempt to fill this need: operational since April 2020, it provides open access to both traditional public health surveillance signals (cases, deaths, and hospitalizations) and many auxiliary indicators of COVID-19 activity, such as signals extracted from de-identified medical claims data, massive online surveys, cell phone mobility data, and internet search trends. These are available at a fine geographic resolution (mostly at the county level) and are updated daily. The COVIDcast API also tracks all revisions to historical data, allowing modelers to account for the frequent revisions and backfill that are common for many public health data sources. All of the data is available in a common format through the API and accompanying R and Python software packages. This paper describes the data sources and signals, and provides examples demonstrating that the auxiliary signals in the COVIDcast API present information relevant to tracking COVID activity, augmenting traditional public health reporting and empowering research and decision-making.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis material is based on work supported by gifts from Facebook, Google.org, the McCune Foundation, and Optum; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grant U01IP001121; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) award DGE1745016; and the Center for Machine Learning and Health (CMLH) at Carnegie Mellon.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board reviewed the surveys as STUDY2020_00000162, and determined that the use of deidentified medical claims and test results was not human subjects research.

	title = {Evaluation of individual and ensemble probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the US},
	year = {2021},
	abstract = {Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in April 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 80 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. A multi-model ensemble forecast that combined predictions from dozens of different research groups every week provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident mortality due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through April 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete forecasts consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Slightly more than half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a na{\"\i}ve baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-week horizon 3-5 times larger than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.Competing Interest StatementAV, MC, and APP report grants from Metabiota Inc outside the submitted work.Funding StatementCMU-TimeSeries: CDC Center of Excellence, gifts from Google and Facebook.
