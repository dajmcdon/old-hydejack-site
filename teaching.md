My primary educational goal is to enhance
statistical literacy and communication among my students. To me, statistical
literacy means combining careful data analysis with scientific
expertise to grapple with problems. Given the quantity of data available
today, I want my students to learn how to engage in the type
of quantitative reasoning and decision making necessary for
understanding
applications in the sciences, business, and public policy.
Going beyond the didacticism of basic statistical literacy, I strive
to inform students about the
fundamental role statistics plays in the comprehension of real-world
phenomena across disciplines and to motivate them to
use this knowledge in their daily lives.
Finally, I endeavor to cultivate curiosity in my students and to create an open and
nurturing learning environment.
This conception of my role as a pedagogue has informed the choices I have
made in the design and implementation of my courses, and I work every
day to inspire my students to develop a similar view. Beyond
statistics, I feel strongly that it is important to connect with students from
backgrounds that do not come to college with the same financial
resources, cultural capital, and training as more privileged
demographics.
